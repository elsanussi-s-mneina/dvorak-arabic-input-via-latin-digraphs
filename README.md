## Introduction

This repository contains a keyboard layout for the Mac OS Catalina operating system.
The keyboard layout is for typing Arabic using Arabic characters.
But instead of the conventional Arabic keyboard layout, this layout is meant to be familiar to users of Dvorak, which is an unconventional keyboard layout for typing Latin characters especially for English. This is accomplished by using multiple key strokes in cases where an Arabic character does not have a romanization that does not use diacritics.

The most important thing to know about this keyboard layout before using it is that "sh" is for "h", and "x" is for "sh". This is so that a person does not have to type "h" followed by a space very often.
